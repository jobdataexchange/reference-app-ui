<p class="w-75">You have created the {{jobTitle}} job.</p>

<p class="w-75"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In a future iteration of the JDX tools and resources an employer would be able to create just a
  job description to view and use internally. The employer would also be able to choose what portions of
  the job description they would like to include in a job posting.</p>

<p class="w-75">However, for the JDX pilot we are asking each employer to take the next step to create a sample job
  posting using all of the information from their job description.</p>
