<p class="pt-4">WELCOME TO THE JOB DATA EXCHANGE PROTOTYPE</p>

<h1 class="pb-4">Improve Employer Signaling Through a Job  Data Standard</h1>

<p class="font-weight-bold">
  Thank you for participating in the Job Data Exchange (JDX) pilot. Today you will be pilot testing the JDX prototype to improve at least one job description and job posting using the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s proposed job data standard (JDX JobSchema+). After pilot testing the JDX prototype you will be provided the opportunity to compare the information included in your original job descriptions and postings with your modified JDX pilot tested version.   If you have any questions during your pilot test please use the chat function at the bottom right of your screen and our BrightHive team will respond.
